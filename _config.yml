          **Participated as a YSSP fellow in Systemic Risk and Resilience (SYRR) group, Advancing System Analysis (ASA) program at IIASA.**
          The project aims to explore the spatial footprints, the virtual flows and the intervowen linkages of land resources related to non-agricultural economic activities in China. Multi-regional and multi-sectoral land use dataset was established, and EEIOA and ENA approaches were further used to identify the land-related connections among economic sectors and regions in China. The result shows that land resource use exhibits a high degree of spatial concentration and heterogeneity. High production-based footprints were mainly found in the east coastal provinces, with high industrial development, while high consumption-based footprint was mainly related to the provincial population. The industrially developed provinces, as the main virtual land outflow areas, also exhibit a more complex network structure, with higher total system throughflow, more resource flow pathways, longer path length, and greater circularity. Our results reveal the association between human socioeconomic activity with direct land demand and virtual land flows. It helps to understand the operation and future land demand of urban systems.

          **I involved as an intern engineer in the AI intelligent medical project at IBM China Research Laboratory.** This endeavor seeks to employ Artificial Intelligence-based image recognition and semantic processing technology to create an AI-fueled medical system based on evidence-based medical experience to realize Artificial Intelligence-assisted medical assistance, such as intelligent health alerts and epidemic-informed decisions. In the project, I mainly worked on the semantic processing of evidence-based medical information, and also efforted to the construction of medical image recognition system.

          My main contribution is in identifying and building entity-level national land-use dataset, and further quantification of land telecouplings and network relationships. I established a land use estimation system using crowdsourced data and machine learning approach. We provide spatially explicit land use inventories at a spatial resolution of 30m for all economic sectors (42 categories). This provides potential value for related studies in industrial ecology and urban ecology, such as quantifying spatially explicit environmental impacts, bridging the gap between top-down and bottom-up statistics, exploring industrial agglomeration and economic geographic distribution, and understanding urban scaling & human mobility.

          During my MS., I revealed how the spatial landscape pattern of anthropogenic heat and land cover influence and shape the urban thermal environment, using source-sink theory and landscape ecology theory. Beijing, one of the biggest megacities in China, was taken as the research area. A hierarchical grid system was established, and the landscape pattern was assessed within each grid. We evaluated the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban heat island intensities through time-series thermal infrared remote sensing images. Multivariate stepwise regression was used to quantify the effects of landscape composition, landscape pattern, and anthropogenic heat intensity to urban heat islands.
