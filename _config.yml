  Wei XIE is currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/About/main.htm) in Environmental Science. 
  He is also a YSSP in Advancing System Analysis ([ASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/asa)) program at [IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/) in the year 2022. He graduated from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), China, in 2015 with a degree in Ecology. 
  He completed his MS degree in Landscape Ecology at the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.rcees.cas.cn/) (2018). 
  
  His main fields of scientific interest include <mark>land system science</mark>, <mark>urban metabolism</mark>, and <mark>industrial system analysis</mark>. 
  
  Specifically, he focuses on: 1) the **land resource use** and virtual **flows** between industrial and socio-economic systems; 
  and 2) the **interactions** between **natural systems and human systems** linked to land use.

  He is familiar with *Python & R*, *GIS*, *PL/SQL*, and *ML* skills.

          He was an intern engineer in the AI intelligent medical project at IBM China Research Laboratory. This project uses AI intelligent image recognition and semantic processing technology to build an AI intelligent medical system based on evidence-based medical experience to realize artificial intelligence medical assistance such as intelligent health warning and epidemic-assisted decision making. In the project, he is mainly involved in the semantic processing of evidence-based medical information and the construction of medical image recognition system.

          He was involved in the digital identification of biodiversity documentation and specimens. This project is based on the identification of current and historical biodiversity distributions using optical image processing (OCR) technology and geospatially formatted data based on text description dumps, with the ultimate goal of establishing a database of the distribution of Chinese vascular plant diversity at the county level or equivalent spatial scale based on historical documentation.
